This problem was taken from codewars. It just said, convert string to camel case.

I decided to allow `_` and `-` at the start or end of a string but not anywhere in between.

If a string has _ or - at the start, allow those characters without modification.

If a string has _ or - in between, remove them and convert to camelCase.
